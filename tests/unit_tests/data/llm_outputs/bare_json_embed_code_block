```
function proofOfWork(block, difficulty):
    target = "0" * difficulty
    nonce = 0
    while True:
        hash = calculateHash(block, nonce)
        if hash.startswith(target):
            return nonce
        nonce += 1

block = getBlockData()
difficulty = getDifficulty()
nonce = proofOfWork(block, difficulty)
```

In this pseudo code, the `proofOfWork` function takes a `block` and a `difficulty` as input. It initializes a `target` string with the desired number of leading zeros based on the difficulty. The function then starts a loop and calculates the hash of the `block` with an incremented `nonce` value. If the hash starts with the required number of zeros, the function returns the `nonce`. Otherwise, it increments the `nonce` and continues the loop until a valid solution is found.

To use the proof of work algorithm, you would need to provide the `block` data and the desired `difficulty` level. The algorithm will return the `nonce` value that satisfies the proof of work requirements.

Please note that this is a simplified representation of the algorithm and actual implementations may have additional complexities and optimizations."
